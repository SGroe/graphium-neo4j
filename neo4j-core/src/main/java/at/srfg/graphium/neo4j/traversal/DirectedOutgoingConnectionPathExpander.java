/**
 * The DirectedOutgoingConnectionPathExpander is an own implementation of the PathExpander that allows to expand OUTGOING relationships
 * under consideration of the direction on the segment. Outgoing rels. are only returned if they are on the "other side"
 * of the segment than the path has entered the segment. Finding out which connection type is the correct one (start or end node connection)
 * is done using nodeId compares.
 * 
 * The inital state is passed in during object creation, it requires the segment and the direction to find out its start direction (rel. type)
